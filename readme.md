# Hello, I'm Astronaut701! 🌌
(And before you ask, no, I don't know why I picked 701 out of all numbers, sorry. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ ) 

* I'm currently a student, and do some programming on the side when I have some free time! 💻
* You may see me in VR spaces (mostly in Neos VR) with the same name... 🥽
* 3D printing, soldering, and just building stuff in general is what I like doing. 🔨
* My current curiosity is with 3D modeling...

And of course, this ``readme.md`` is, and always will be, a work-in-progress.
